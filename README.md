Tasks Managing site with quick shortcuts and dragging options.

keyBoard shorcuts to know:
Alt + 1/2/3 - move task to different list.
Alt + t - move task to the top of the list.
Alt + b - move task to the bottom of the list.
Alt + Delete + 1/2/3 - clear all tasks from the list.

All of the above updates both in DOM and local Storage

You are also able to use Drag n Drop which updates in DOM and Local storage.

The site is fully functional, it has default background changing colors.

Personal Note: 
I spent most of the time figuring out the tests, APi tests didnt pass, even when i used the exact requested Form,
but it is saving and loading From the API.

Thanks for your time.
